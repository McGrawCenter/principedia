To-do
Learning strategies link-maker in wysiwyg editor - need to be able to click button, get a popup window, and then select from the learning strategies.


Add dropdown to comment forms to select the section to which the comment applies.


Alter the course analysis template to list the comments for each section under that section


Need a form to create a new course analysis entry - this could be just a few fields (semester, instructor, year, etc) and then when submitted, it created a new CA post and redirects the user to the editable version of that page.


Add shortcode that inserts metadata fields for ‘add new course analysis’ form. Add code to create new course analysis based on this form and then redirect user to editable version of the course analysis.


Why is button not showing up on in-page editor


Save course analysis when submit button is pressed.


Dropdown CA nav is not working on Safari
